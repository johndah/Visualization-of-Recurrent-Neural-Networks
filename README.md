# Visualization of Recurrent Neural Networks

This developed system is the implementation of my Master Thesis to visualize Recurrent Neural Networks with text prediction as a testbed. It contributes with user trust, trust for developers of model's generalization and insights how to improve neural network architecture to optimize performance.
